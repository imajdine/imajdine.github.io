    <h1>Programming</h1>
  </section>
  <h2>Note:</h2>
  <h3>Most code snippets here come from my "A2-Programming Assignment 1" and "A5-Programming Assignment 2".</h3>
  <h2>Constants/Variables</h2>
  <h3>Variables are values the user can change throughout their code. This is important because it allows dynamic programs that can respond to user input on the fly. Variables can be one of four types, a float (a number which contains decimals), an int (a whole number), a boolean (can only be true or false), or a string (a series of characters). Variables can be declared with this following nomenclature:</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
let firstTimeInCloud = true;</pre>
  <h3>Here, we create a variable with type type 'boolean'. We set our bool to true.</h3>
  <h3>Variables can also be constants. These are variables which cannot be changed after being declared. They are declared like this: </h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
const chosenPair = decideItem();</pre>
  <h3>Here I declare a variable named 'chosenPair', which has a value that is decided by a function (which will be covered later). This variable cannot be changed after this line!</h3>
  <h2>Conditional Statements (if statements)</h2>
  <h3>Conditional statements are chunks of code which only happen if a condition is met. For example, a game can use this by identifying when a user's health drops under 0. If this is true, then the game can kill the player. They can be set-up like this: </h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
if (player.balance >= 125) {
  log("1 worker hired!")
  player.balance -= 125
  player.numWorkers++;
} else {
  log("Not enough money..")
}
</pre>
  <h3>You may notice the 'else' in there. 'else' statements can be used to tell the program what to do if the condition isn't met. While not necessary, these are very useful. Here, I'm asking the program to check if the player's balance is over 125$. If it is, higher a worker. But if it isn't (this happens in the else), tell the user they don't have enough money.</h3>
  
  <h2>Repetition Structures (for/while loops)</h2>
  <h3>Loops are chunks of code which are ran over and over again until a condition is met. These differ from an if statement because an if statement only runs <u>when</u> the condition is met, while these run <u>until</u> the condition is met.</h3>
  <h3>There are two main types: for loops, and while loops For loops are mainly useful when you have a general guess of how many times you need the loop to run. This can be especially useful for looping through an array. For loops are set up like this:</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
for (i = 0; i < inventory.length; i++) {
  log("-" + inventory[i])
}
</pre>
<h3>While this looks extremely complicated, it can be broken down into three simple steps. First, you need to set up your variable. I am doing this when I write 'i = 0'. I begin at 0 because I want to cycle through my array, which starts at 0. In most cases, you'll set your variable to 0, but certain circumstances may change that. We add a semicolon to tell the program we are done declaring our variable, and to move on. Second, we are setting our stop condition. You can think of this section as 'keep going unless this isn't true. Here, I am telling the program to keep going aslong as i is less than the length of my inventory array. We add another semi-colon to show that we're moving on, and finally, we tell the program what to do everytime it loops. We just want to increase our variable by one, so we do 'i++''.</h3>
  <h3>So to explain, this piece of code will go through every item in the inventory, and log it to the user. Simple, but useful!</h3>
  <h3>Next are while loops. These are useful when you don't know when the condition will become true. I have used a while loop in a password system before, where the user enters their password, and if it is not correct, the while loop keeps going. If it is, however, the while loop notices the condition is true and stops. They are simple to set-up:</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
while (!passwordCorrect) {
  if (prompt("System: " + "Enter your password") == password) {
    passwordCorrect = true;
  } else {
    log("Incorrect!")
    let proceed = prompt("Try Again? (yes),(no)")
    if (proceed == "yes") {
      log("System: Go ahead.")
    } else {
          enteranceCode()
    }
  }
}</pre>
  <h3>I've set up my condition here to be when a variable is false. The loop will keep going until it detects the password is correct. The password will only become correct when the user inputs their valid password, and then a variable will be set to true so the loop will stop.</h3>
  <h2>Built-in Functions</h2>
  <h3>Built-in Functions are functions which JavaScript developers have embedded into the coding language for user ease-of-use. These can be used to edit a string, generate a random number, or more. Below, I show two examples of JavaScript functions:</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
let choice = prompt(cloudName + ": What do you want to do? Add item(add), Remove item(remove), (return)").toLowerCase();</pre>
  <h3>At the end, i'm using the 'toLowerCase' function to turn the user's input from the prompt all lowercase. This is useful to detect the user's choice without much lines of code. I did not declare this function, because it is built-in to the JavaScript language.</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">let treePrice = Math.floor(Math.random() * 200) + 50</pre>
  <h3>Here, I used two built-in functions to generate a random number from 50-200. The Math.floor function rounds down to the nearest integer, and the Math.random function generates a float from 0-1. This notation above can be used to generate a random integer any range you want!</h3>
  <h2>Custom Functions</h2>
  <h3>Custom functions are incredibly versatile chunks of code the user creates and calls upon several times throughout their code. You can put anything you want into a custom function, and the code inside it will only run when you call it. They can be setup like this:</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
function log(whatToLog) {
  console.log(whatToLog);
}</pre>
  <h3>Above is a function that I've created in every JavaScript assignment I have done in this course. This function is very simple, it's a shortcut which allows the coder to type simply 'log(text)', rather than the long 'console.log(text)'. I can call this at any time throughout my code, and it saves a lot of time. Remember though, custom functions can be a lot longer, with my longest one being in the hundreds of lines!</h3>
  <h2>Arrow Functions</h2>
  <h3>Arrow functions are a deviation of custom functions which shortens the function notation. This can take a function from 5-10 lines to simply one line. They can be set up like this: </h3>
<pre class="prettyprint">
function random(highest){
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * highest
}</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint">
const random = (highest) => Math.floor(Math.random() * highest)</pre>
  <h3>The first code block shows how this arrow function would look normally, and the second is the actual arrow function. Setting up an arrow function requires converting it to a 'const variable'. Then, after your equal sign, you put your paraments in paranthesis and then an arrow (which is where the name comes from!). After your arrow, you put in your one line of code, and your arrow function is complete!</h3>
  <h2>Function Documentation</h2>
  <h3>In the industry, it is important to properly document your code so other programmers can understand what it does. In the later half of the ICS3U course, students must use specific function documentation. Here is how it is done:</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
/**  FUNCTIONNAME
  * Description of the function 
  *
  * @param {datatype} parameter1 - Description of parameter1
  * @param {datatype} parameter2 - Description of parameter2
  *
  * @returns {datatype} Description of return value
  *
  * 
  */
  function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
    return returnValue;
  }</pre>
  <h3>All you need to do is take this, and replace all the placeholders (FUNCTION-NAME, the description, @param and @returns) with applicable answers for your function. For example, below I show how I used the documentation for the log() function shown earlier on this page.</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
/**
 * FUNCTION NAME: log
 * Prints a message to the console
 *
 * @param {string} whatToLog - The message to be logged
 *
 * @returns {undefined} does not return a value
 */
function log(whatToLog) {
  console.log(whatToLog)
}</pre>
  <h2>Arrays</h2>
  <h3>An array is basically just a list of items. Arrays are very useful and can be used in situations such as inventories, a list of names, or other similar situations. Below, I will show an example of an array I used.</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
let possiblePayTypes = ["debit", "credit", "cash", "acorns"]</pre>
  <h3>Here, I declare an array with the name 'possiblePayTypes', and give it four values. These values can be accessed like this:</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
console.log(possiblePayTypes[2])
OUTPUT: cash</pre>
  <h3>You may be wondering why feeding '2' into the array logs 'cash' when 'credit' is the second item. This is because arrays actually start at 0, meaning the first element, 0, would be 'debit'.</h3>
